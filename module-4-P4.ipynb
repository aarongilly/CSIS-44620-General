Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."

    "Honestly I don't have a great answer for this. I could easily see why *Last Nite* or *99 Red Balloons* would yield mostly neutral results. Both songs are fairly opaque in their message. The sentiment polarity for *Bang!* was more or less spot-on, if anything I might consider that too low of a score. I suppose the repeated motif \"Bang!\" doesn't carry a lot of semantic meaning sans the context of its pronunciation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now *why* it rates Johnny Cash's song that Google's AI labs describes as \"a poignant reflection on aging, regret, and the consequences of past actions, particularly his struggles with addiction\" as anything *other than* overwhelmingly negative is a bit beyond me. The lyrics aren't even really ambiguous or up to interpretation. It's about being sad about being old and making the choices you've made. So... not what I was expecting. "
